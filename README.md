A brief description of what this project does

# Ten10TechTest ‚Äì Cypress E2E Tests

This folder contains Cypress end-to-end tests for the **Ten10TechTest Interest Calculator** application.  
Each feature from the product requirements has been mapped to a dedicated test spec for clarity and maintainability.

## üîë Environment Variables

All secrets are managed via `cypress.env.json` (ignored from git).  

Example `cypress.env.json` (dummy data):

```json
{
  "EMAIL": "user@example.com",
  "PASSWORD": "Password123!",
  "URL": "http://localhost:3000/"
}
```
---
## In CI pipelines, set these as environment variables:

npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/" --browser chrome

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
The app currently only displays one generic error message (Please fill in all fields.).
Tests are written against that behaviour, but can be extended when field-specific errors are added.

Some calculations (e.g. Monthly interest) follow the app‚Äôs current logic (rate / 10) rather than financial convention (rate / 12). Tests are aligned to app behaviour for now.

Images or missing assets (404s) may throw console errors, but tests focus only on functional behaviour.
